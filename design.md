# Finance Tracker Design

## 1. Product Vision
Finance Tracker is a minimal, intelligent, emotion-aware personal finance web app designed to help users understand **why** they spend — not just what they spend. It prioritizes psychological insight, privacy, and clarity over data overload.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional finance apps:
- Focus on budgeting and categorization
- Overwhelm users with dashboards
- Ignore emotional triggers
- Rely heavily on bank integrations

Users need behavioral insight, not spreadsheets.

## 3. Target Users
- Professionals (24–40) seeking financial clarity
- Freelancers with irregular income
- Privacy-conscious individuals
- Self-development oriented users

## 4. Unique Value Proposition
Unlike Mint-style trackers:
- No bank scraping required
- Emotion-based tagging
- Narrative summaries
- Impulse detection
- Burnout prediction
- Future financial projection
- Privacy-first design

## 5. Core Philosophy
Built on:
- Loss aversion theory
- Present bias
- Emotional regulation
- Decision fatigue modeling

Principles:
- Awareness reduces impulse
- Narrative reduces anxiety
- Minimalism increases consistency
